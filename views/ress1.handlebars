        Home Automation with Voice Recognition</a>
    <p class="description">A project built on Raspberry Pi which can process natural
        voice commands from any mobile device to control any electrical appliance or initiate any
        automated task. The project can work in presence of LAN or through internet remotely. It
        also features fire, gas and theft alarm system along with automation for elders or disabled.

        on Arduino</a>
    <p class="description">I am Designing sub-systems of Home Automation System and then attempting to merge them into
        one.
        Several sub-systems includes - Smart Switch Board, LCD Display, Password Interface, Theft Alarm System, Fire
        Alarm, Gas Alarm, Automatic Door Bell, Automatic Night Light, Automatic Human Presence Light, Notification LED
        and Worker Robot.

        Following and Obstacle Avoiding Robot</a>
    <p class="description">A Line Following and Obstacle Avoiding Robot is a Robot (usually a vehicle) which have both
        the characteristics
        of the Line Following Robot and the Obstacle Avoiding Robot i.e.,
        it follows a coloured path (usually a black line) and avoids any obstacle on the way.

        Checking Input, Output &amp; Delay in VHDL on FPGA</a>
    <p class="description">In this tutorial, we will implement our first program on FPGA board. We will basically work
        with input, output
        and time delay. We will implement a program in which the LED will blink naturally, but when a user presses the
        push button then the LED will stop blinking and glow
        continuously.
